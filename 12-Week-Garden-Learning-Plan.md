## 🌱 DAILY 15-MINUTE LITERACY HABIT (1:00-1:15 PM)

**This happens FIRST every day, at the start of the session. It is completely separate from the garden theme.**

**Purpose:** Build reading confidence through predictable, gentle routines using simple decodable books.

**Format is IDENTICAL every day - no surprises:**

| Time | Activity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1:00-1:05 | Sound Warm-Up | Pick 2-3 simple CVC words (cat, sun, map, log, dog, pig, etc.). Blend sounds together slowly. Stop if frustrated. |
| 1:05-1:10 | Reread Same Book | Read the SAME short decodable book all week. You support as needed. Confidence > new material. |
| 1:10-1:15 | Gentle Copy | Copy ONE short sentence from the book OR copy 3 simple words. Stop exactly at 15 minutes. |

**Important Rules for Literacy Habit:**
- Same book for the entire week
- No new books mid-week
- Stop before fatigue
- Smile and end early
- Success over volume
- This is separate from garden vocabulary

**Example CVC Words to Use:**
at, cat, hat, sat, mat
an, can, man, pan, ran
ig, pig, big, dig, wig
ot, hot, pot, dot, got
ug, bug, hug, rug, mug
sun, fun, run, bun
map, lap, cap, tap, nap
log, dog, fog, hog

## PARENT NOTES

### Key Principles:
1. **Literacy is minimal** - 5 words max per week, reading only 10-15 min
2. **Oral reasoning is primary** - let him explain verbally
3. **Math is always concrete** - use real objects, no abstract symbols
4. **Follow his interest** - if he wants to explore deeper, do it
5. **Stop before fatigue** - better to end early with positive feelings

### Materials Needed:

**📚 Literacy (Daily Use):**
- Decodable books (12 total — one new book per week, reread daily)
- Word cards (you make these — 5 new words per week)
- Pencil for writing/tracing

**🌱 Garden & Science:**
- Seeds (beans work well for visibility)
- Potting soil (bag)
- Small pots or garden space
- Clear cups/containers for root viewing (Week 2)
- Watering can
- Plastic bottles for drip irrigation (Week 5)
- Thumbtack/pin for poking bottle cap holes (Week 5)
- Garden trowel/small spade for digging (Weeks 2-3)
- Two shallow trays for soil comparison (Week 3)
- Small compost container (Week 3)
- Vegetable scraps/leaves for composting (Week 3)
- Magnifying glass (Week 4 — leaf veins, Week 8 — bugs)
- Flashlight (Week 4 — simulating sun direction)
- Craft sticks for marking height (Week 6)
- Small envelopes/bags for seed storage (Week 9)
- Stones or small objects for building rows (Week 7)

**🔢 Math:**
- Ruler/measuring tape
- Cubes/counters (for addition, subtraction, modeling)
- Building blocks (for growth models)

**🎨 Drawing & Recording:**
- Paper (plain, for drawings and charts)
- Coloring pencils/crayons
- Calendar (for counting days and scheduling)

**🍎 Other:**
- Daily snacks (for break time)

### Adaptation Guidelines:
- If reading is too hard → do more oral work
- If math is too easy → add larger numbers
- If weather is bad → do indoor activities
- If interest wanes → switch to building/movement

### Assessment:
- No formal tests
- Observe his explanations
- Note confidence levels
- Celebrate small wins
- Document with photos
